Hi the weird thing you get when you combine a programmer and a cat.
I am a C# prgrammer / gamedev.
I also use C++ for games.
I joined github because i can look at other people's code for things that i dont know how to do.
I will also like to post some code for people that will mabe find it usefullüê±.
